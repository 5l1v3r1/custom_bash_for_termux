## .dotfiles
These dotfiles are mostly config files
## .inputrc
contains the vim-keybindings to begin with
## .vimrc
a bit of tweaking
## .vim/
This dir contains mostly the plugins(names) for vim
## That's all folks
## Also, bash.bashrc is the present config of my bashrc and I've made a major update to colors.properties inspired by the solarized theme for linux terminals. Enjoy tweaking with these!
